让我们说中文： 

微博（Micro-blog）是指一种基于用户关系信息分享、传播以及获取的通过关注机制分享简短实时信息的广播式的社交媒体，比如twitter、新浪微博。 人们在微博上主要进行的活动就是社交活动，在社交活动当中，人们找到与自己有相同爱好的人，并且参加到感兴趣的话题中的讨论；或者关注自己在现实生活中认识的人，通过其发布的内容来获取最新的动态。 在社交平台上，社交的属性是不可忽略的，而作为微博上最广泛的交互方式，“评论”是人们进行社交活动的最主要方式。评论天然带有社交属性，因此从社交质量的角度对评论进行评价是一件很有意义的事情。 特别地，大语言模型（LLM）尽管已经做了良好对齐，但是其输出仍与人类有较为明显的风格差异，在社交媒体的场景中表现的尤为明显。因此，我们制定了“社交质量”评价标准，同时发布一个使用我们的标准对微博上评论的打分，希望可以推动相关研究的进一步开展。

Let's speak English: 

Micro-blog refers to a broadcast-style social media that shares short, real-time information based on user relationship information sharing, dissemination, and acquisition through a follow-up mechanism, such as Twitter and Sina Weibo. The main activities people do on Weibo are social activities. In social activities, people find people with the same hobbies as themselves and participate in discussions on topics of interest; or follow people they know in real life and get the latest updates through their posts. On social platforms, the social attribute cannot be ignored, and as the most widely used interactive method on Weibo, "comments" are the main way for people to conduct social activities. Comments naturally have social attributes, so it is very meaningful to evaluate comments from the perspective of social quality. In particular, although the large language model (LLM) has been well aligned, its output still has a relatively obvious style difference from humans, which is particularly obvious in the context of social media. Therefore, we have formulated a "social quality" evaluation standard and released a score for comments on Weibo using our standard, hoping to promote further development of related research.
